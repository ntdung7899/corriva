The primary risk driver is a <strong style=\"color: var(--fg-primary)\">high correlation concentration (0.67)</strong> between US and International equities, which reduces diversification benefits during market downturns. Annualized volatility increased 2.1% month-over-month, primarily driven by recent tech sector earnings uncertainty. Consider increasing fixed income allocation by 3-5% to improve risk-adjusted returns. The current Sharpe ratio of 1.45 suggests favorable risk-reward, but sector-level VaR indicates elevated tail risk in the technology sub-portfolio.",
